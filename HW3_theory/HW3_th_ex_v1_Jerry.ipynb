    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a fundamental tool among the unsupervised learning model. Consider a problem with a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{x_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with no labels, we are aiming at finding some hidden structure within the data, namely, we would like to find clusters in the dataset. Classifiers have been studied in TP but mainly for supervised learning, here the data are not labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm tries to classify the dataset in $K$ clusters. Each cluster is represented by a centroid, meaning the average of the points within the cluster. We note $C_k$ the set of points of a cluster $k$ and $\\mu_k$ its centroid. Then, the algorithm minimizes the intra-cluster variance, in other words, it tries to reduce the distance between the points of the cluster and the centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, the algorithm works iteratively in two main steps: \n",
    " - Points are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to existing centroid\n",
    " - Centroids are updated by taking the average of the points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The Loss function of the problem can be written as:\n",

    "\n",
    "To prove the equality, we first define the dataset as $D = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. We assume that we classify the dataset into $K$ disjoint clusters, which means that the union of all clusters $C_1 \\cup C_2 \\dots \\cup C_K$ is equal to the whole dataset $D$, and every point $x_i$ belongs to exactly one specific cluster. If a point $x_i$ is in cluster $C_k$, then its assigned centroid $\\mu(i)$ is simply $\\mu_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the total loss function by grouping the points based on which cluster they belong to. Instead of summing $i$ from 1 to $n$ in one go, we can split the sum into $K$ parts, calculating the error for each cluster separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_K) = \\sum_{x_i \\in C_1} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_1 \\rVert^2 + \\sum_{x_i \\in C_2} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_2 \\rVert^2 + \\dots + \\sum_{x_i \\in C_K} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_K \\rVert^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "For the second question, the term $\\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} \\, \\lVert x_i - \\mu_k \\rVert^2$ represent the sum of the square distance of each points in cluster $k$ to its centroid. Physically, this measures the intra-cluster variance. It tells us how \"spread out\" the points are within that specific group. A lower value means the cluster is very compact and the points are gathered tightly around the center $\\mu_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this form of the loss function is more convenient because it separates the problem into independent parts. When we want to minimize the loss to find the optimal position for a centroid $\\mu_k$, we can ignore all other clusters. The terms for other clusters $C_{j}$ (where $j \\neq k$) do not depend on $\\mu_k$, so they act as constants. This means we can simplify the optimization problem significantly:\n",

    "This expression tells us that $\\mu^t(i)'$ is the specific centroid that achieves the minimum possible distance to $x_i$ among all available clusters at time $t$.

    "To compare $J_t$ and $J_{t+1}$, we simply need to chain together the results we proved in the previous questions. The K-means algorithm consists of two phases in one full iteration: the assignment phase and the update phase. We can analyze the change in the loss function for each phase separately to see the total effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, from Question 3, we analyzed the assignment step where we fix the centroids and move data points to their closest cluster. We proved that this operation never increase the total distance because we explicitly choose the minimum distance for every point. Therefore, the loss function after reassignment $J_t'$ is less than or equal to the initial loss $J_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_t' \\leq J_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, from Question 5 and Question 6, we looked at the update step where we fix the assignments and calculate new centroids. We showed that taking the average of the points is the optimal way to minimize the intra-cluster variance. Because the new centroid $\\mu^{t+1}$ is the mathematical minimum, it gives a lower or equal error compared to the old centroid. This give us the second inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_{t+1} \\leq J_t'$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can combine these two inequalities into a single chain. Since $J_{t+1}$ is smaller than $J_t'$, and $J_t'$ is smaller than $J_t$, it follows by transitivity that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_{t+1} \\leq J_t' \\leq J_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result implies that the total error $J_{t+1}$ is always less than or equal to $J_t$. This proves the monotonicity of the K-means algorithm, guaranteeing that the objective function will decrease or stay the same after every complete loop, and the model will not diverge."

    "To analyze the convergence, we first identify a trivial lower bound for the loss function. The function $J$ is defined as the sum of squared Euclidean norms:\n",

    "$$J(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_K) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lVert x_i - \\mu(i)\\rVert^2$$\n",

    "Since the Euclidean norm $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert$ represents a distance, it is always non-negative. Furthermore, the square of a real number is always non-negative. Therefore, we are summing $n$ non-negative terms, which implies that the total sum cannot be negative. Thus, the sequence of loss values $(J_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ is bounded from below by 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_t \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we recall the result from Question 7, where we proved that the algorithm minimizes the objective function at each step. The assignment step minimizes $J$ with respect to the cluster assignments $c$, and the update step minimizes $J$ with respect to the centroids $\\mu$. This process is known as coordinate descent. Because each step reduces (or maintains) the error, the sequence is monotonically decreasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_{t+1} \\leq J_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem from real analysis. This theorem states that any sequence of real numbers that is monotonically decreasing and bounded from below must converge to a limit. Since our sequence $(J_t)$ is always decreasing but can never go below 0, it must converge to a finite value $J^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} J_t = J^*$$\n",

    "While we have proved that the algorithm converges, it does not guarantee finding the best possible solution. This is because the distortion function $J$ is a non-convex function. The K-means algorithm performs coordinate descent on $J$, which means it steps down the \"valley\" of the loss function, but it can easily get stuck in a local optimum instead of the global minimum. To illustrate a situation where the algorithm fails to classify the data correctly, we can design a scenario based on symmetry.\n",

    "$$\\text{True Center } B = (10, 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the algorithm should classify the data into a \"Left Cluster\" and a \"Right Cluster.\" However, if we choose the initial centroids poorly, the algorithm might fail. Let us initialize the two centroids on the vertical axis, which acts as the perpendicular bisector between the two data clouds:\n",

    "In the assignment step, the algorithm looks for the closest centroid for each point. For any data point located in the top half of the plane (positive y), the distance to the top centroid $\\mu_1$ is smaller than the distance to the bottom centroid $\\mu_2$, regardless of whether the point belongs to the left or right cluster. Consequently, $\\mu_1$ captures the top half of Cluster A and the top half of Cluster B. Similarly, $\\mu_2$ captures the bottom halves of both clusters.\n",

The algorithm will converge to a stable state where it separates the data into \"Top\" and \"Bottom\" groups, which is completely orthogonal to the true \"Left\" and \"Right\" structure. This situation confirms that K-means is susceptible to local optima and that the initialization is crucial for its success."

    "The configurations of centroids we saw in Question 9 imply that the K-means algorithm is sensitive to initialization. Depending on where we start, the algorithm can converge to different final states. This implies that the objective function $J$ does not have a single, unique valley that leads to the best solution. Instead, the landscape of the loss function is rugged, containing many different valleys of varying depths known as local minima. While the coordinate descent approach guarantees that the loss will decrease and converge, it does not guarantee that the valley we fall into is the deepest one, which would be the global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This existence of multiple distinct stable states allows us to conclude that the K-means optimization problem is non-convex. In mathematical optimization, a strictly convex function resembles a smooth bowl where any ball dropped inside will roll to the exact same bottom point. Because K-means allows for suboptimal stable states where the algorithm gets stuck, the function cannot be convex. The non-convexity arises largely because of the \"min\" operator in the assignment step; when a centroid moves just far enough, a data point suddenly switches its assignment from one cluster to another, creating \"kinks\" or breaks in the function's curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove formally that $J$ is not convex, we can use the definition of convexity. A function is convex if, for any two points in the solution space, the function value at the midpoint is lower than or equal to the average of the function values at the two endpoints. If we find one case where the midpoint has a higher error, the function is not convex. Let us consider a simple 1D dataset with two points $x_1 = -1$ and $x_2 = 1$, and we want to find $K=2$ centroids.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let us address the notation in the problem statement. The formula provided in the question uses $w_i$ inside a sum over dimensions $j$, but the denominator sums $w_j$, and the context mentions \"favoring some directions.\" This strongly suggests a typo where the weight should depend on the dimension $j$, not the data point index $i$. We will assume the correct term is $w_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by writing down the total loss function using the weighted distance provided. Let $W_{total} = \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j$ be the normalization constant. The weighted objective function $J_{weighted}$ sums this distance over all points $i=1$ to $n$:\n",

    "We want to transform this equation into the standard squared Euclidean form $\\sum (a - b)^2$. We can do this by absorbing the weight $w_j$ into the squared term. Recall that $c \\cdot z^2 = (\\sqrt{c} \\cdot z)^2$ for any non-negative weight $c$.\n",

    "$$J_{weighted} \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lVert \\tilde{x}_i - \\tilde{\\mu}(i) \\rVert^2$$\n",

    "However, one problem arised with initial Boltzmann Machine (BM) -- like its parent models in statistical physics (as the SK model) -- all the units are interacting through complicated dependencies.

Indeed, if some term like $P(v_1, v_2 | v_3)$ which suggests that the correlation $x_1$ and $v_2$ depends on $v_3$ and this is clearly none linear.\n",

Unlike the Restricted Boltzmann Machine where layers are independent, the general Boltzmann machine allows connections between all variables, meaning we must account for interactions within the visible layer and within the hidden layer as well.\n",

However, because this is a non-restricted machine, we also include the matrix R and matrix S. The matrix R captures the pairwise interactions between the visible units themselves, and S capture the interactions among the hidden units. Finally, the vectors b and c corresponds to the bias parameters for the visible and hidden layers respectively. This full connectivity allow the model to represent higher-order correlations that simpler models cannot."
